Univeral Like/Dislike for websites. 
TODO: Firefox addon and Chromium addon.
Phase 1: Allow local users to like/dislike websites and check which ones they like or dislike.
Phase 2: Share these on a server hosted somewhere (my guess is here on GitHub?)
Phase 3: Filter out AWS/Corporate IPs and create/enforce a one person (browser) per vote system.

Someone also please remind me to put the sheikel hat in this area. Preferably it'll be bitcoin and maybe a paypal or two (one for americans because I'm nice to them :P )
